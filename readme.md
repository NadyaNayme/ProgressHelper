# Progress Helper

Announces when your Smithing progress is nearly 100% for switching hammers to Breakdown.

## How to Install & Required Settings

To install Progress Helper copy & paste this link into Alt1's browser app:
`alt1://addapp/https://nadyanayme.github.io/ProgressHelper/dist/appconfig.json`

If you do not have Alt1 Toolkit installed already you can [download it from runeapps.org](https://runeapps.org/alt1). In order for Voice of Seren to work make sure your Runescape settings for Game and UI Scale settings are set to `100%` as this is required for Alt1 to be able to read your game screen.

## Features

- Announces "Switch Hammers" using Microsoft's Text-To-Speech when smithing progress is nearly complete.

## Planned Features

- Customability really. What it is is what you get for now.
